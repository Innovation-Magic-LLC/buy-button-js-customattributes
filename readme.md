# BuyButton.js with custom attributes

~ For custom engineering solutions, please contact our firm [get-magic.com](https://get-magic.com) ~

This repository contains a modified version of the Shopify Buy Button library that allows developers to add custom attributes to product line items. While the default Buy Button library does not support this functionality, our implementation enables sending additional data from external applications to Shopify, facilitating the creation of custom retail functionality.

## Features

- Add custom attributes to product line items during checkout
- Attributes are visible to customers during the checkout process
- Attributes are accessible in the Shopify admin panel and through webhooks as metadata

    </p>

## Limitations

- ~~Custom attributes are not displayed in the cart before checkout~~ 
    - Please refer to features/renderCustomAtrributesInCart branch to see how to modify the code to render custom attributes using the existing variantTitle in the template.
    - This code is checked into main, currently.
- mocha test framework is purged
- After compiling the library, you will need to manually merge your bits with the live shopify bits. We have provided our compiled version in ./latest folder.
